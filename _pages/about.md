Hi there! My name is Xingjian. I recieived my MSc in Statistics at [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/) in 2023.

<span style="color:red">I'm looking for PhD opportunities in statistics or related fields. If you think I'm the suitable candidate to work with you please do get in touch!

Research interests
------
My current interests are mainly focus on Bayesian statistics and machine learning. Specifically now I have two potential ideas: 

- Developing methods to import prior information into the models which are difficult to set informative priors for its parameters. For example, using the prior information of model-derived quantities to indirectly set informative priors for parameters.

- Improving the interpretability of machine learning models through methods such as uncertainty quantification.

Both of above ideas originated from my master's thesis. You can see how I came up with these ideas in the "Projects" section above!

Education
------
* MSc in Statistics with Distinction, University of Exeter, 2022-2023
* Bachelor of Natural Science in Information and Computing Science, China University Of Mining & Technology (Beijing), 2017-2021
