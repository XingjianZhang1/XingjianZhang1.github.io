Hi there! My name is Xingjian. I recieived my MSc in Statistics at [University of Exeter](https://www.exeter.ac.uk/) in 2023.

<span style="color:red">I'm looking for PhD opportunities in statistics or related fields. If you think I'm the suitable candidate to work with you please do get in touch!

Research interests
------
My current interests are mainly focus on Bayesian statistics and machine learning/ deep learning. Specifically now I have two potential ideas: 

- Developing methods to import prior information into the models which are difficult to set informative priors for its parameters. For example, using the prior information of model-derived quantities to indirectly set informative priors for parameters.

- Improving the interpretability of machine learning models through methods such as uncertainty quantification.

Both of above ideas originated from my master's thesis.
