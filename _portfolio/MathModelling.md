### Topic:

- Modelling taxi drivers’ strategy of picking up passengers in the airport.

- Then optimising the boarding area for taxi to maximise efficiency while ensuring safety by using the model above

### Method:

- Queueing theory, Monte Carlo simulation

Under the assumption that the driver's goal is to maximize benefits/minimize losses, I first used queuing theory to build a driver's decision model. Then used Monte Carlo simulation for common waiting area scenarios and determined the optimal design by comparing the simulated average waiting times.


### Result:
