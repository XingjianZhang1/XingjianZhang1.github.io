### Aim:

- Improving the performance of traditional futures trading strategies through news data. 

Traditional futures strategies such as the Turtle Trading Strategy only use price information for trading, so the performance is poor. Therefore We used information other than price to improve the prediction performance.

### Method:

- Text sentiment analysis, Logistics regression

Specifically, we use text sentiment analysis to quantify the sentiment of news text on prices, and use logistic regression to fit the relationship between future price trends and news sentiment values, thereby improving the performance of traditional strategies.

### Result:

When backtested, the improved strategy using text sentiment increased returns by 31% compared to the original strategy.
